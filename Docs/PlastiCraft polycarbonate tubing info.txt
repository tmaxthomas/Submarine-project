1.       What is the ID and OD tolerance for this tube? +/- .025
2.       You list that you can cut to size – how straight is this cut? For reference, I have a second piece of tubing that I wish to mate to the end of this one and would like to minimize any gaps at the point where they mate. All of our tubes are saw cut. Saw marks will be present and it is not perfectly smooth, but it should not be a jagged cut or anything. If you need a ‘perfect’ cut then we could cut on the lathe for you, but that would cost additional in comparison to saw cut.
3.       Is there any additional cost associated with having the tubing cut to size? Typically a cutting charge does apply. The cutting charge will depend on the length of the cuts and how many cuts.
